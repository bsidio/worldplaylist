# World Playlist
This project aims to create a simple public web radio system based on Youtube links.

## How does it work ?
If you want to contribute just copy/paste the Youtube link of the music on the interface and click on 'Add' or press Enter on your keyboard.
Because it's supposed to be a radio with music content, Youtube videos must follow these rules:
 - Only from Youtube
 - No longer than 10 minutes
 - No sensitive content
 - Music content please

If the link you have provided is valid, then it's added on the world playlist queue
and will be played soon :)

## Interface options
- You can mute/unmute the sound from the World playlist by checking the mute checkbox.
- You can see the next 10 songs of the playlist by clicking on "PLaylist" on the top left of the banner.
